## Hi there 👋

I'm Bingbing! Welcome to my GitHub profile. Here's a little about me:  

- 🌱 I’m diving deep into **supervised learning**.  
- 🤝 I’m open to collaboration on **machine learning and cybersecurity** projects.  
- 📚 Always curious and eager to learn something new.  
- 💬 Ask me about **Python, data analysis, or just tech stuff in general**!   
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can cook better than I can debug code (but I’m improving on both 🚀).  

Feel free to explore my repositories and share your thoughts. Let's create something amazing together!
